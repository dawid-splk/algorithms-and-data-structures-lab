# Algorithms and Data Structures laboratory

This repository contains tasks completed as part of the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course, which was held during the 2nd term of my studies. The tasks were based on implementing iterators, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, binary trees, B-trees, hash tables, and graphs. Among the tasks were also algorithms that utilized the mentioned structures, such as the Huffman Coding Algorithm and the Graham scan (lab11).
